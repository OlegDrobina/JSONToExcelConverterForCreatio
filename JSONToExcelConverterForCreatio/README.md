This utility was created to convert the JSON response returned from SelectQuery request call.
The instruction is the following:

1. Download the code
2. Build it using Visual Studio 2022 or later
3. Create the appconfig.txt file with the following content:
```
input=C:\temp\CasesResponse.json
output=C:\temp\CasesResponse.xlsx
```
4. Place the appconfig.txt file in the same folder where the executable is located
5. Run the executable

C:\temp\ - is an example folder path. You can use any folder path you want, just make sure to update the appconfig.txt file accordingly.
CasesResponse.json - is the JSON response file you received from SelectQuery request call. This file should exist before running the utility.
CasesResponse.xlsx - is the output Excel file that will be created.
